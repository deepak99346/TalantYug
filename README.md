# TalentYug Landing
TalentYug is a frontend-only landing website that showcases a structured placement infrastructure platform designed for Tier 2/3 Colleges, Companies, and Students, focusing on solving common placement challenges such as unstructured processes, limited hiring visibility, and lack of student readiness through clear product storytelling, modern UI/UX design, and startup-style information flow. The project includes multiple public-facing pages (Home, Colleges, Companies, Students, About, Resources) with a common navbar, CTA-driven sections, testimonials, pricing layouts, and resource UIs, built using HTML, CSS/Tailwind, and basic JavaScript as a portfolio- and resume-ready frontend project.
Simple Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold for the TalentYug landing pages.
